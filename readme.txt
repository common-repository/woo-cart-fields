== Description ==

This plugin allows you to create fields in wp-admin, and these fields are displayed for user input on the cart page.

The fields are only displayed on the cart page, on the checkout it will show the user the info they have entered for the fields.

It handles multiples of an item by splitting them into individual rows. Think of selling a book, and adding a field for dedication. You might want to buy a copy for your Aunt Hilda and one for your Aunt Maud, if you selected 2 for quantity it wouldn't add 2 in one cart row, it would add 2 cart rows of 1x so you would have a field for each one.

You can also add required fields, the cart validates with javascript but user's also can't proceed to checkout until they have filled all required fields.

Currently the only type of field is text but more types are coming.
